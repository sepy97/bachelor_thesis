# Bachelor thesis, DCAM MIPT, 2019

This repository presents text and all necessary source files and documents for my bachelor thesis in 2019 (department of control and applied mathematics in MIPT).

There are 4 working implementations of a concurrent Stack (lock-based, optimistic, HP-based and RTM-based) and 2 working implementations of a concurrent Treap (lock-based and RTM-based).
Results of experiments with these implementations are in .csv and .numbers files and can be also observed as plots in .png files.

The text of my thesis was written in LaTeX via Overleaf, generated pdf-file is presented in the repository (bachelor_thesis.pdf), keynote for the defense is in the file bachelor_keynote.pdf.
